        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Prasanth, a passionate 3rd-year Computer Science student at Vignan University. My journey into the fascinating world of technology and innovation started early, and it has only grown stronger during my time at Vignan. From the very first lines of code to more advanced projects, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for how technology can transform ideas into reality. My academic path has been focused on honing my skills in various domains of computer science, while continually pushing the boundaries of my knowledge.

            <li>I am particularly passionate about web development, where creativity meets functionality. Crafting intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly web applications has become my primary focus. I have been working extensively with frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These tools have empowered me to bring my ideas to life, and I’m constantly seeking to improve my design and development capabilities.</li>
            
            <li>In addition to my love for frontend development, I have a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms. This knowledge has proven invaluable in solving complex problems efficiently and effectively. I also possess a strong understanding of databases, which allows me to manage data and integrate backend functionality with frontend interfaces seamlessly.</li>
            
            <li>Academically, I’ve maintained a CGPA above 9, which reflects my commitment to excellence. Balancing coursework with self-learning, I’m always on the lookout for new technologies and trends in the tech industry. I believe that continuous learning is the key to staying ahead in this ever-evolving field, and I make it a point to keep expanding my skill set.</li>
            
            <li>Currently, I am seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my technical expertise and gain hands-on experience in a professional environment. I am eager to collaborate with experienced professionals who can guide me on this journey, helping me refine my skills and deepen my understanding of real-world challenges.</li>
            
            <li>Beyond the technical aspects, I value teamwork and collaboration. I enjoy working in dynamic environments where I can share knowledge, exchange ideas, and contribute to collective problem-solving efforts. I thrive on challenges that push me to think creatively and develop innovative solutions. This passion for learning and problem-solving has driven me to take on various projects, each contributing to my growth as a developer and problem-solver.</li>
            
            <li>In summary, I am a dedicated and ambitious individual with a deep passion for technology. I am constantly seeking opportunities to apply my skills, learn from others, and contribute meaningfully to any project I am involved in. I look forward to the journey ahead and am excited about the opportunities to make a positive impact in the tech industry.</li>
